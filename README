= ruby-ogg

== Synopsis

ruby-ogg brings pure Ruby love to the Ogg container format. It provides
the abstraction to read packets from an Ogg bitstream without worrying
about things such as captures and pages.

== Vorbis

Vorbis is not the same as Ogg. Vorbis is an audio codec which is commonly
packed in the Ogg container format with the file extension ".ogg". Because
Vorbis has become so deeply associated with Ogg, a Vorbis metadata decoder
is bundled with ruby-ogg. Not only does it provide an example of how to
use ruby-ogg, but is also fully functional. See the Vorbis page for
more information.

== Features
